Okay, I can run that command for you.

It looks like you decided not to run the command `bun add --dev jiti`. What would you like to do instead?

How can I run bunx eslint . with eslint.config.ts

_**Assistant**_

ESLint should automatically detect configuration files named `eslint.config.js` or `eslint.config.ts` in the root of your project when you run `bunx eslint .`.

So, as long as your `eslint.config.ts` file is in the same directory where you run the command (or a parent directory), `bunx eslint .` should use it by default. `bunx` itself can typically handle executing the TypeScript configuration file.

If you want to be explicit or if ESLint isn't finding it automatically (perhaps it's named differently or in an unusual location), you can use the `-c` or `--config` flag:

```bash
bunx eslint . -c eslint.config.ts
```

You could also update your `lint` task in `mise.toml` if you want to always specify the config file explicitly:

```toml
[tasks.lint]
description = "Run ESLint with specific config"
run = "bunx eslint . -c eslint.config.ts"
```

That doesn't work. How can we add jiji with bunx

_**User**_

but how can we use it with bunx

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I understand you've installed `jiti` and want to know how to use it with `bunx`.

`bunx` is used to execute package binaries, and `jiti` is a tool primarily used to directly run JavaScript or TypeScript files without needing a separate build step.

So, you can use `bunx` to run the `jiti` command like this:

```bash
bunx jiti <path/to/your/script.ts> [arguments...]
```

For example, if you had a script named `check-something.ts`, you could run it with:

```bash
bunx jiti ./check-something.ts
```

`bunx` will find and execute the `jiti` binary (using the version you just installed), and `jiti` will then run your `./check-something.ts` script.

However, based on our previous conversation, it seems you might be trying to use `jiti` to solve the problem with running ESLint with `bunx eslint . -c eslint.config.ts`. While you _can_ run `jiti` using `bunx` as shown above, `jiti` isn't typically used to execute other command-line tools like `eslint` itself. The command `bunx eslint . -c eslint.config.ts` _should_ work if ESLint and its necessary TypeScript plugins (`@typescript-eslint/parser`, etc.) are correctly installed and your `eslint.config.ts` is valid.

Could you tell me what error message you received when you tried running `bunx eslint . -c eslint.config.ts`? That would help diagnose the actual issue. Using `jiti` here might be a workaround for a different underlying problem (like missing dependencies or a configuration error).
