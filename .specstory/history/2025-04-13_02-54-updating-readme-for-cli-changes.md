# Updating README for CLI Changes (2025-04-12 19:54:16)

_**User**_

Can we update this readme based on cli updates?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the README based on the CLI updates. First, let me check the current state of the CLI implementation to ensure we make accurate updates.

---

Read file: src/cli/index.ts

---

Based on the CLI implementation, I notice several updates that need to be reflected in the README. Let me update it to include the new features and options.

---

````diff
  - **Filtering**: Filter logs by minimum log level
  - **JSON Formatting**: Pretty-prints JSON content in logs with syntax highlighting
+ - **Theme Support**: Multiple built-in themes and custom theme support
+ - **Configuration**: Customizable through config files and command-line options

  ## Installation
  - `-o, --output <file>`: Path to output file
  - `--list-parsers`: List available parsers
+ - `-t, --theme <theme>`: Theme to use (default, dark, light, minimal, or custom theme name)
+ - `--list-themes`: List available themes

  ### Log Levels
  # Use a specific parser
  logsdx input.log --parser json
+ ```
+
+ ### Using Themes
+
+ ```bash
+ # List available themes
+ logsdx --list-themes
+
+ # Use a specific theme
+ logsdx input.log --theme dark
+
+ # Use a custom theme
+ logsdx input.log --theme my-custom-theme
````

```

I've updated the README to include the new features and options that were present in the CLI implementation. The main changes include:

1. Added new features:
   - Theme Support
   - Configuration options

2. Added new command-line options:
   - `-t, --theme`: For selecting different themes
   - `--list-themes`: For listing available themes

3. Added a new section "Using Themes" with examples showing how to:
   - List available themes
   - Use built-in themes
   - Use custom themes

The README now better reflects the current state of the CLI implementation. Would you like me to make any additional changes or clarifications to the documentation?
