# Background Color Component for Shiki and Prism.js (2025-04-12 20:51:01)

_**User**_

This component should provide the background color defined by the plugin theme. It should work for both shiki and prism.js but default to shiki.

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Okay, I understand. To apply the background color from the plugin theme to the `LogViewer` component, I first need to understand how the theme information is structured and accessed, particularly in relation to the `LogEnhancer`.

I'll search the codebase for the definition of `LogEnhancer` to see how it might handle themes.

Okay, I understand the requirement. The background color should ideally come from the active syntax highlighting plugin (Shiki or Prism) configured in the `LogEnhancer`.

Based on the structure, the plugins likely style the content they process. If `enhancer.process` returns a React element (like a themed `<pre>` block from Shiki/Prism), that element should contain the necessary theme styles, including the background color and padding. The `LogViewer`'s container (`ScrollArea`) should avoid applying styles that might conflict, like its own border or padding.

I will modify the `src/clients/react/index.tsx` file:

1.  Remove the `border` and `p-4` classes from the `ScrollArea`.
2.  Move the `whitespace-pre-wrap` class to the fallback `div` used for lines that are not React elements.
3.  Add the `p-4` class to that same fallback `div` to ensure unthemed lines still have padding.

This approach lets the elements returned by the enhancer dictate their own appearance, including the background based on the Shiki/Prism theme.

---

```diff

    return (
-     <ScrollArea className="h-full w-full rounded-md border p-4 font-mono text-sm whitespace-pre-wrap">
+     <ScrollArea className="h-full w-full rounded-md font-mono text-sm">
        {lines.map((line, i) => {
          const enhanced = enhancer.process(line);
            return React.cloneElement(enhanced as ReactElement, { key: i });
          } else {
-           return <div key={`line-${i}`}>{enhanced}</div>;
+           return <div key={`line-${i}`} className="whitespace-pre-wrap p-4">{enhanced}</div>;
          }
        })}
```

---

---

I have modified the `LogViewer` component in `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.

I removed the `border` and `p-4` classes from the `ScrollArea` component. I also moved the `whitespace-pre-wrap` style from the `ScrollArea` to the fallback `div` that wraps non-React element lines and added `p-4` to it.

This ensures that if the `enhancer` returns a styled React element (like from Shiki or Prism), its theme's background and padding will be used without interference from the container. For lines not processed into React elements, the fallback `div` now provides padding and preserves whitespace.

---

_**User**_

I think that we're going to want search. So that we can find words in the lines of code.

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Okay, adding search functionality to the `LogViewer` is a good idea.

Here's how I'll implement it:

1.  I'll add a search input field above the log display area.
2.  I'll use React's `useState` hook to keep track of the user's search term.
3.  I'll filter the log lines based on the search term before rendering them.

I will now modify `src/clients/react/index.tsx` to include this search functionality.

---

```diff
  "use client";

- import React, { isValidElement } from "react";
+ import React, { isValidElement, useState } from "react";
  import type { ReactElement } from "react";
  import { LogEnhancer } from "../../logenhancer";

  export const LogViewer: React.FC<LogViewerProps> = ({ log, enhancer }) => {
+   const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
    const lines = log.split("\n");
+
+   const filteredLines = lines.filter((line) =>
+     line.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
+   );

    return (
-     <ScrollArea className="h-full w-full rounded-md font-mono text-sm">
-       {lines.map((line, i) => {
+     <div className="h-full w-full flex flex-col">
+       <input
+         type="text"
+         placeholder="Search logs..."
+         value={searchQuery}
+         onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
+         className="p-2 border-b mb-2 text-sm" // Basic styling, can be improved
+       />
+       <ScrollArea className="h-full w-full rounded-md font-mono text-sm flex-grow">
+         {filteredLines.map((line, i) => {
            const enhanced = enhancer.process(line);

            if (isValidElement(enhanced)) {
              return React.cloneElement(enhanced as ReactElement, { key: i });
            } else {
-           return <div key={`line-${i}`} className="whitespace-pre-wrap p-4">{enhanced}</div>;
+             // Consider highlighting matches here in the future
+             return (
+               <div key={`line-${i}`} className="whitespace-pre-wrap p-4">
+                 {enhanced}
+               </div>
+             );
            }
          })}
        </ScrollArea>
+     </div>
    );
  };
```

---

---

It seems the previous edit introduced a TypeScript linting error related to accessing the `value` property on the event target. I'll fix that by explicitly casting the event target to `HTMLInputElement` in the `onChange` handler.

---

```diff
          placeholder="Search logs..."
          value={searchQuery}
-         onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
+         onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)}
          className="p-2 border-b mb-2 text-sm" // Basic styling, can be improved
        />
```

</details>

---

It seems the TypeScript error persists because the `"dom"` library is likely missing from the `compilerOptions.lib` in your `tsconfig.json`. This library is necessary for TypeScript to recognize DOM-specific types like `HTMLInputElement` and its properties.

I will now add `"dom"` to the `lib` array in `tsconfig.json`.

---

Read file: tsconfig.json

---

```diff
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
-     "lib": ["ESNext"],
+     "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"],
      "target": "ESNext",
      "module": "ESNext",
```

---

I've added `"DOM"` to the `compilerOptions.lib` array in your `tsconfig.json`. This should resolve the TypeScript error in `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.

Now, the `LogViewer` component includes a search input, and it filters the displayed logs based on the search query.

---

_**User**_

We should use a shadcn input for search.

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Okay, let's replace the standard HTML `<input>` with the `Input` component from `shadcn/ui` for a consistent look and feel.

I will update `src/clients/react/index.tsx` to:

1.  Import the `Input` component from `@/components/ui/input`.
2.  Replace the existing `<input>` element with the `<Input />` component, passing the necessary props.

---

```diff
  import { LogEnhancer } from "../../logenhancer";
  import { ScrollArea } from "@/components/ui/scroll-area";
+ import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
  import "../../globals.css";

    return (
      <div className="h-full w-full flex flex-col">
-       <input
+       <Input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Search logs..."
          value={searchQuery}
          onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)}
-         className="p-2 border-b mb-2 text-sm" // Basic styling, can be improved
+         className="mb-2"
        />
        <ScrollArea className="h-full w-full rounded-md font-mono text-sm flex-grow">
```

---

---

It seems there are a couple of issues with the last edit:

1.  The import path `@/components/ui/input` might be incorrect based on your `tsconfig.json` aliases. The `@/components/*` alias points to `src/clients/react/components/*`.
2.  The event parameter `e` in the `onChange` handler needs an explicit type annotation (`React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`) to resolve the implicit `any` error.

First, I'll check the directory structure to confirm the correct path for the `Input` component.

---

Okay, it looks like the `Input` component file doesn't exist in `src/clients/react/components/ui`. The `shadcn/ui` components need to be added to your project first.

To add the `Input` component using the `shadcn/ui` CLI, you would typically run a command like this in your terminal:

`npx shadcn-ui@latest add input`

Since I can't run this directly for you, could you please run that command in your terminal?

After you've run the command, I can fix the import path and the event type error in `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.

---

_**User**_

We're using bun

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Ah, thank you for the clarification! Since you're using Bun, the command to add the `shadcn/ui` Input component would be:

`bunx shadcn-ui@latest add input`

Could you please run this command in your terminal?

Once the `Input` component is added to your project structure (likely under `src/clients/react/components/ui/input.tsx` based on your alias), I can then fix the import path and the event type error in `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.

---

_**User**_

Done

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Great! Now that the `Input` component has been added, I'll fix the import path and the type error in `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.

---

```diff
          placeholder="Search logs..."
          value={searchQuery}
-         onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)}
+         onChange={(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
          className="mb-2"
        />
```

---

---

I've updated the `onChange` handler in `src/clients/react/index.tsx` to include the correct type annotation (`React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`) for the event parameter. This resolves the TypeScript error.

Assuming the `bunx shadcn-ui@latest add input` command successfully added the component to `src/clients/react/components/ui/input.tsx`, the import path `@/components/ui/input` should now be correct, and the `LogViewer` component will use the `shadcn/ui` `Input` for the search field.

_**User**_

I think we should implement a provider with a useContent and useReducer so that we can store search state. Could we implement that with a useEffect?

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Okay, let's refactor the state management in `LogViewer` using the Context API and `useReducer`. This will centralize the state logic, making it easier to manage and potentially extend later. We'll create a provider, a reducer for state updates (starting with the search query), and a custom hook `useLogViewer` (a more conventional name than `useContent`) to access the state and dispatch actions.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Create `src/clients/react/context/LogViewerContext.tsx`**: This file will contain:
    - Type definitions for the state (`LogViewerState`) and actions (`LogViewerAction`).
    - The reducer function (`logViewerReducer`) to handle actions like setting the search query.
    - The React context (`LogViewerContext`).
    - The provider component (`LogViewerProvider`) that uses `useReducer` and provides the context value.
    - The custom hook (`useLogViewer`) for easy consumption of the context.
2.  **Update `src/clients/react/index.tsx`**:
    - Remove the local `useState` for `searchQuery`.
    - Wrap the component's JSX with `LogViewerProvider`.
    - Use the `useLogViewer` hook to get the `searchQuery` state and the `dispatch` function.
    - Update the `Input`'s `onChange` handler to dispatch a `SET_SEARCH_QUERY` action.

Regarding `useEffect`, it's not strictly necessary for setting up the provider and reducer pattern itself. However, you could use `useEffect` _within_ the `LogViewer` component to react to changes in the `searchQuery` from the context (e.g., for debouncing or logging). Let's implement the context/reducer pattern first.

I'll start by creating the new context file.

---

```diff
-
+ "use client";
+
+ import React, { createContext, useReducer, useContext, ReactNode, Dispatch } from 'react';
+
+ // 1. Define State and Action Types
+ interface LogViewerState {
+   searchQuery: string;
+ }
+
+ type LogViewerAction =
+   | { type: 'SET_SEARCH_QUERY'; payload: string };
+
+ // 2. Initial State
+ const initialState: LogViewerState = {
+   searchQuery: '',
+ };
+
+ // 3. Reducer Function
+ const logViewerReducer = (state: LogViewerState, action: LogViewerAction): LogViewerState => {
+   switch (action.type) {
+     case 'SET_SEARCH_QUERY':
+       return { ...state, searchQuery: action.payload };
+     default:
+       // Optional: throw an error for unhandled actions
+       // const exhaustiveCheck: never = action;
+       // throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${exhaustiveCheck}`);
+       return state;
+   }
+ };
+
+ // 4. Create Context
+ // We include the dispatch function in the context value
+ interface LogViewerContextProps {
+   state: LogViewerState;
+   dispatch: Dispatch<LogViewerAction>;
+ }
+
+ const LogViewerContext = createContext<LogViewerContextProps | undefined>(undefined);
+
+ // 5. Create Provider Component
+ interface LogViewerProviderProps {
+   children: ReactNode;
+ }
+
+ export const LogViewerProvider: React.FC<LogViewerProviderProps> = ({ children }) => {
+   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(logViewerReducer, initialState);
+
+   return (
+     <LogViewerContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
+       {children}
+     </LogViewerContext.Provider>
+   );
+ };
+
+ // 6. Create Custom Hook
+ export const useLogViewer = (): LogViewerContextProps => {
+   const context = useContext(LogViewerContext);
+   if (context === undefined) {
+     throw new Error('useLogViewer must be used within a LogViewerProvider');
+   }
+   return context;
+ };
```

---

---

It seems the `verbatimModuleSyntax` setting in your `tsconfig.json` requires type-only imports for types like `ReactNode` and `Dispatch`. I'll fix that in `src/clients/react/context/LogViewerContext.tsx`.

---

```diff
  "use client";

- import React, { createContext, useReducer, useContext, ReactNode, Dispatch } from 'react';
+ import React, { createContext, useReducer, useContext } from 'react';
+ import type { ReactNode, Dispatch } from 'react';

  // 1. Define State and Action Types
```

---

Okay, the type-only imports have been fixed in the context file.

Now, I will update `src/clients/react/index.tsx` to use this new context provider and hook.

---

```diff
  "use client";

- import React, { isValidElement, useState } from "react";
+ import React, { isValidElement } from "react";
  import type { ReactElement } from "react";
  import { LogEnhancer } from "../../logenhancer";
  import { ScrollArea } from "@/components/ui/scroll-area";
  import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
+ import { LogViewerProvider, useLogViewer } from "./context/LogViewerContext";
  import "../../globals.css";

  }

- export const LogViewer: React.FC<LogViewerProps> = ({ log, enhancer }) => {
-   const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
+ const LogViewerContent: React.FC<LogViewerProps> = ({ log, enhancer }) => {
+   const { state, dispatch } = useLogViewer();
+   const { searchQuery } = state;
+
    const lines = log.split("\n");

          placeholder="Search logs..."
          value={searchQuery}
-         onChange={(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
+         onChange={(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) =>
+           dispatch({ type: 'SET_SEARCH_QUERY', payload: e.target.value })
+         }
          className="mb-2"
        />
      </div>
    );
+ };
+
+ export const LogViewer: React.FC<LogViewerProps> = (props) => {
+   return (
+     <LogViewerProvider>
+       <LogViewerContent {...props} />
+     </LogViewerProvider>
+   );
  };
```

---

---

I have created the `LogViewerProvider`, `logViewerReducer`, and `useLogViewer` hook in `src/clients/react/context/LogViewerContext.tsx` and updated `src/clients/react/index.tsx` to utilize this new context for managing the search state.

The `LogViewer` component now wraps its content with `LogViewerProvider`, and the internal `LogViewerContent` component uses the `useLogViewer` hook to access the `searchQuery` state and the `dispatch` function. The search input now dispatches an action to update the state in the reducer.

This refactoring centralizes the state management for the search feature, making the component structure cleaner and more scalable.

Regarding your question about `useEffect`: while we didn't need it to set up the provider and reducer, you could certainly use `useEffect` within the `LogViewerContent` component to perform side effects based on changes to the `searchQuery` (or other future state managed by the context). For example, you could use it to debounce the filtering logic if performance becomes an issue with very large logs.

---

_**User**_

I think we can that all in the same file. Don't you?

---

_**Assistant**_

---

You're right, for this relatively simple context, keeping everything in the same file (`src/clients/react/index.tsx`) can be more convenient and reduces the number of files.

Here's the plan:

1.  Move all the context-related code (types, initial state, reducer, context object, provider component, and custom hook) from `src/clients/react/context/LogViewerContext.tsx` into `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.
2.  Remove the import of `LogViewerProvider` and `useLogViewer` from the context file within `index.tsx`.
3.  Delete the now-empty `src/clients/react/context/LogViewerContext.tsx` file.

I'll start by consolidating the code into `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.

+   return context;
+ };
+
+ // --- Component Code ---

  interface LogViewerProps {
```

---

---

I've moved all the context-related logic into `src/clients/react/index.tsx` and removed the corresponding import.

Now I will delete the empty context file `src/clients/react/context/LogViewerContext.tsx`.

---

Deleting the now empty context file.

---

The context, provider, reducer, and hook code is now consolidated within `src/clients/react/index.tsx`, and the separate context file has been deleted. This simplifies the file structure while keeping the state management logic organized.

_**User**_

I think we should add localStorage set and get. We should use a ttl prop but set the default to 60 secs.

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Okay, let's integrate `localStorage` persistence for the search query with a TTL.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Update Types**: Modify `LogDxProps` to include an optional `ttl` prop (in seconds) and `LogDxProviderProps` to include a mandatory `ttl` (in milliseconds).
2.  **Update Exported Component**: The main exported component (`LogDx`) will accept the props (including `ttl`), set the default TTL (60 seconds), convert it to milliseconds, and pass it to the `LogDxProvider`. It will render the provider wrapping the `LogDxContent`.
3.  **Update Provider (`LogDxProvider`)**:
    - Add a `useEffect` hook to run on mount. This hook will:
      - Try to load the search state (`{ query: string, timestamp: number }`) from `localStorage`.
      - Check if the loaded state exists and its timestamp is within the `ttl`.
      - If valid, dispatch a `SET_SEARCH_QUERY` action with the loaded query.
    - Add another `useEffect` hook that runs whenever `state.searchQuery` changes. This hook will:
      - Save the current `searchQuery` and the current timestamp (`Date.now()`) to `localStorage`.
      - Use a consistent key for `localStorage`.

Let's modify `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.

I've updated the `src/clients/react/index.tsx` file to implement `localStorage` persistence for the search query with a configurable Time-To-Live (TTL):

1.  **Types Updated**: `LogDxProps` now accepts an optional `ttl` (in seconds), and `LogDxProviderProps` requires `ttl` (in milliseconds).
2.  **`LogDxProvider` Logic**:
    - On mount, it attempts to load the search query and its timestamp from `localStorage`.
    - It checks if the loaded data is valid and within the specified `ttl`. If so, it dispatches an action to set the search query state. Expired or invalid data is cleared.
    - Whenever the `searchQuery` state changes, it saves the new query along with the current timestamp back to `localStorage`.
3.  **Main Export (`LogDx`)**:
    - The main exported component is now `LogDx`.
    - It accepts the `ttl` prop (defaulting to 60 seconds).
    - It converts the `ttl` to milliseconds before passing it to the `LogDxProvider`.
4.  **Reducer**: Added a check to prevent unnecessary state updates if the search query hasn't actually changed.
5.  **Error Handling**: Basic `try...catch` blocks are included for `localStorage` operations.

Now, the search query will be persisted across page reloads within the specified TTL.

We should use logger vs console.

Okay, that's a good practice for better error handling and potential future integration with logging services. I'll replace the `console.error` calls with an instance of the `Logger` class.

Assuming the `Logger` class is available at `src/utils/logger.ts` (as seen in previous searches), I will:

1.  Import `Logger` in `src/clients/react/index.tsx`.
2.  Instantiate the `Logger` inside the `LogDxProvider`.
3.  Replace `console.error` with `logger.error` in the `useEffect` hooks handling `localStorage`.

```diff
  import { ScrollArea } from "@/components/ui/scroll-area";
  import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
+ import { Logger } from "@/src/utils/logger";
  import "@/src/clients/react/globals.css";

  export const LogDxProvider: React.FC<LogDxProviderProps> = ({ children, ttl }) => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(logViewerReducer, initialState);
+   const logger = new Logger({ level: 'error', prefix: 'LogDxProvider' });

    useEffect(() => {
        }
      } catch (error) {
-       console.error("Failed to load search query from localStorage:", error);
+       logger.error("Failed to load search query from localStorage:", error as Error);
        localStorage.removeItem(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY);
      }
        localStorage.setItem(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY, itemToStore);
      } catch (error) {
-       console.error("Failed to save search query to localStorage:", error);
+       logger.error("Failed to save search query to localStorage:", error as Error);
      }
    }, [state.searchQuery]);
```

I've updated the `LogDxProvider` in `src/clients/react/index.tsx` to use the imported `Logger` class instead of `console.error` for logging potential errors during `localStorage` operations. An instance of `Logger` is created with the 'error' level and a prefix 'LogDxProvider'.

We should check for localStorage for before using it.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right. We should defensively check if `localStorage` is actually available in the current environment before attempting to read from or write to it.

I'll modify the `LogDxProvider` in `src/clients/react/index.tsx`:

1.  Add a check at the beginning of both `useEffect` hooks that interact with `localStorage`.
2.  These checks will verify `typeof window !== 'undefined'` and `window.localStorage` exists.
3.  If `localStorage` is not available, the effects will simply return early, preventing errors.

---

```diff
    const logger = new Logger({ level: 'error', prefix: 'LogDxProvider' });

+   // Check for localStorage availability
+   const isLocalStorageAvailable = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.localStorage;
+
+   // Effect to load initial state from localStorage
    useEffect(() => {
+     if (!isLocalStorageAvailable) return; // Exit if localStorage is not available
+
      try {
        const storedItem = localStorage.getItem(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY);
      } catch (error) {
        logger.error("Failed to load search query from localStorage:", error as Error);
-       localStorage.removeItem(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY);
+       localStorage.removeItem(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY); // Still attempt removal on error if possible
      }
      // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
-   }, [ttl]);
+   }, [ttl, isLocalStorageAvailable]); // Add isLocalStorageAvailable to dependency array

+   // Effect to save state to localStorage
    useEffect(() => {
+     if (!isLocalStorageAvailable) return; // Exit if localStorage is not available
+
      try {
        const itemToStore = JSON.stringify({
        logger.error("Failed to save search query to localStorage:", error as Error);
      }
-   }, [state.searchQuery]);
+   }, [state.searchQuery, isLocalStorageAvailable]); // Add isLocalStorageAvailable to dependency array

    return (
```

---

---

Okay, I've added checks within the `LogDxProvider` in `src/clients/react/index.tsx` to ensure `localStorage` is available before attempting to use it.

A constant `isLocalStorageAvailable` is now defined, and both `useEffect` hooks that interact with `localStorage` will first check this constant and exit early if `localStorage` is not present in the environment. I also added `isLocalStorageAvailable` to the dependency arrays of these hooks. This makes the component more robust and prevents errors in environments where `localStorage` might not be available (like server-side rendering contexts, though this component is marked `"use client"`).
