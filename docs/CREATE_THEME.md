## Advanced Usage

### Extending Existing Themes

After creating a theme, you can extend it programmatically:

```typescript
import { extendTheme } from "logsdx";
import { myAwesomeTheme } from "./themes/my-awesome-theme";

const extendedTheme = extendTheme(myAwesomeTheme, {
  customWords: {
    CRITICAL: { color: "error", styleCodes: ["bold", "blink"] },
  },
});
```

### Batch Theme Creation

Create multiple theme variants:

```typescript
import { generateThemeVariants } from "logsdx";

const { light, dark } = generateThemeVariants({
  name: "my-theme",
  colors: {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

## Integration

Themes created with the interactive tool are fully compatible with:

- LogsDX CLI (`--theme` flag)
- Configuration files (`.logsdxrc`)
- Programmatic API
- Web browser rendering
- CI/CD pipelines
